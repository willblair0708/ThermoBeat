# ThermoBeat

ThermoBeat is an innovative thermoelectric energy harvesting system designed to power implantable medical devices, such as pacemakers and neurostimulators, by converting small thermal gradients within the human body into usable electricity. Our integrated system combines a high-performance thermoelectric generator (TEG) module and a custom ultra-low voltage boost converter based on the LTC3108 to provide a sustainable and maintenance-free energy source.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains hardware schematics, firmware, software, and documentation for the ThermoBeat project. The main directories are as follows:

- `hardware`: Schematics and PCB designs for the TEG module and LTC3108 boost converter.
- `firmware`: Source code and header files for the firmware running on the TEG module and LTC3108 boost converter.
- `software`: Source code and header files for any data processing and simulation software related to the ThermoBeat project.
- `documentation`: Design documents, test reports, and user manuals for the ThermoBeat system.
- `sensors`: Integration with pacemaker sensory data, including machine learning models and analysis.
